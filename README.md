# Handwritten Digit Prediction with PyTorch
This repository contains code for a lab where I utilized the MNIST database collection to develop a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model. The goal of the project is to accurately predict handwritten digits using the PyTorch deep learning framework.

## Overview
Dataset: MNIST handwritten digit dataset.

Model: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

Framework: PyTorch.
